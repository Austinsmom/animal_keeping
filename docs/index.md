## About
Animal base is a tool to keep track of the animal population in a
lab. It consists of a mysql database backend to store subject-related
information and a JavaFX-written graphical interface to
view/edit/create entries in the database.

## Development status

The project is under ongoing development and things will
change. Nevertheless, it is in daily use in the lab and the basic
functionality is implemented.

Feel free to try.
